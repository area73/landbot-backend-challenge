## Future Improvements

Due to limited time and scope, some features and improvements have been left out of the scope of this project.

Below are some improvements that could be implemented in the future:

- Global Error Handling: Implement a global middleware to capture and manage errors in a centralized way.

- API Documentation: Implement Open API (Swagger) or a similar tool to automatically document routes and their contracts.

- Inversion of Control (IoC): Use a dependency container like Inversify to manage dependencies.
